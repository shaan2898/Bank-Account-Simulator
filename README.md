Bank Account Simulator in C++

Implements tools such as Pointers, Structs and C++ functions to create a bank account simulator. Users have the ability to create accounts, deposit or withdraw money, send money to other accounts, print or delete an account, as well as display all of the accounts stored in the bank.

Basic C++ knowledge required and some experience with pointers, classes, and calling functions using switch/case. All of the functions are implemented on an array that holds structs.
